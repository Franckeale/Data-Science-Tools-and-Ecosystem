# Data-Science-Tools-and-Ecosystem
The main objectives of this notebook are to:  - Introduce the fundamental concepts of Data Science - Familiarize with popular programming languages and libraries - Explore different Data Science tools - Learn arithmetic expressions and how to perform basic calculations in Python.

## Exercise 3: Data Science Tools and Ecosystem are summarized

In this notebook, we will explore the fundamental concepts and tools of Data Science. We will cover different programming languages, libraries, and tools that are commonly used in Data Science projects. We will also learn some arithmetic expressions and how to perform basic calculations in Python.

## Exercise 4: Some of the popular languages that Data Scientists use are:

- Python
- R
- SQL
- Julia
- Scala

## Exercise 5: Some of the commonly used libraries used by Data Scientists include:

- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

### Exercise 6: Data Science Tools
The following table lists some of the popular Data Science tools:

## Exercise 7: Below are a few examples of evaluating arithmetic expressions in Python

An arithmetic expression is a combination of numbers and mathematical operators that result in a numerical value. In Python, we can use the following operators to perform arithmetic operations:

- Addition: +
- Subtraction: -
- Multiplication: *
- Division: /
- Modulus: %

## Exercise 8: This a simple arithmetic expression to mutiply then add integers

## Exercise 9: This will convert 200 minutes to hours by diving by 60
