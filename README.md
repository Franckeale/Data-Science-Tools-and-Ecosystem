# Data-Science-Tools-and-Ecosystem
The main objectives of this notebook are to:  - Introduce the fundamental concepts of Data Science - Familiarize with popular programming languages and libraries - Explore different Data Science tools - Learn arithmetic expressions and how to perform basic calculations in Python.

Exercise 2: Data Science Tools and Ecosystem
Exercise 3: Data Science Tools and Ecosystem are summarized
In this notebook, we will explore the fundamental concepts and tools of Data Science. We will cover different programming languages, libraries, and tools that are commonly used in Data Science projects. We will also learn some arithmetic expressions and how to perform basic calculations in Python.

Exercise 4: Some of the popular languages that Data Scientists use are:
Python
R
SQL
Julia
Scala
Exercise 5: Some of the commonly used libraries used by Data Scientists include:
NumPy
Pandas
Matplotlib
Seaborn
Scikit-learn
Exercise 6: Data Science Tools
The following table lists some of the popular Data Science tools:

data_science_tools = {
    'Jupyter Notebook': 'An open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text.',
    'Apache Hadoop': 'A framework that allows for distributed storage and processing of large datasets across clusters of computers.',
    'Apache Spark': 'An open-source distributed computing system that allows you to process large datasets quickly.',
    'Tableau': 'A business intelligence and data visualization tool that helps people see and understand their data.',
    'Apache Kafka': 'A distributed streaming platform that allows you to publish and subscribe to streams of records.'
}

Exercise 7: Below are a few examples of evaluating arithmetic expressions in Python
An arithmetic expression is a combination of numbers and mathematical operators that result in a numerical value. In Python, we can use the following operators to perform arithmetic operations:

Addition: +
Subtraction: -
Multiplication: *
Division: /
Modulus: %
Let's explore some examples:

Exercise 8: This a simple arithmetic expression to mutiply then add integers
# Addition and multiplication
a = 3
b = 4
c = 5
d = (a*b)+5
​
print(d)
17
# Division and modulus
e = 17
f = 3
g = e / f
h = e % f
print(g)
print(h)

Exercise 9: This will convert 200 minutes to hours by diving by 60
minutes = 200
hours = minutes / 60
print(hours)
3.3333333333333335
